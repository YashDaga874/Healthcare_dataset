# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

This repository contains code and data files related to a project on predicting health insurance costs using machine learning.

## Files Included

- **`Health_insurance_dataset.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis, data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

- **`health_insurance_dataset.py`**: Python script version of the notebook containing the project code.

- **`insurance.csv`**: Dataset file (CSV format) containing the health insurance data used for training and testing the models.

- **`archive (6).zip`**: Zip archive file (possibly containing additional datasets or resources related to the project).

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to build machine learning models to predict health insurance costs for individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, etc.

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

- Open and run the `Health_insurance_dataset.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  
- Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build machine learning models (e.g., using Polynomial Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost), and evaluate the model performance.

### Running the Python Script

- Alternatively, you can execute the project code directly from the `health_insurance_dataset.py` script using Python:

  ```bash
  python health_insurance_dataset.py
  ```

## Dataset Information

The `insurance.csv` dataset contains information about individuals including age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, region, and their respective health insurance costs.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
  
- Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters further.
