# Medical Cost Prediction

This repository contains code and documentation related to a project on predicting medical costs for individuals using regression models. The project was conducted between November 2023 and December 2024.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop regression models that can accurately quantify medical costs for individuals based on various features. Three different regression algorithms were explored and implemented: Polynomial Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression.

## Key Contributions and Achievements

- Analyzed a dataset comprising over 1300 records to extract insights and identify significant patterns related to medical costs.
  
- Engineered relevant features from the dataset and utilized descriptive graphs to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, which enhanced the predictive accuracy of the models.

- Developed robust regression models using Python and the scikit-learn library, achieving high classification accuracy of over 85%.

- Successfully predicted medical insurance charges for individuals based on historical data, contributing to informed decision-making in healthcare cost estimation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost


### Usage


## Future Improvements

- Explore ensemble methods combining multiple regression models for further accuracy enhancement.
  
- Implement feature selection techniques to identify the most influential features for medical cost prediction.
